      <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
      <p>At Trisora Tech Bay, we’re rethinking how businesses adopt technology. Instead of forcing people to adapt to software, we adapt software to people. We build technology that’s intuitive, culturally aware, and requires almost no training to use.</p>

      <h3>What We Build</h3>
      <p>We specialize in creating custom software and IoT solutions that work for everyone — from local shop owners and small restaurants to large enterprises. Our approach is horizontal, meaning we don’t lock ourselves into one industry. Our tech can work anywhere, for anyone.</p>

      <h3>How We Work</h3>
      <p>We work closely with field experts to deeply understand business pain points and develop software around the actual workflows of workers and teams. We believe tech should empower — not overwhelm.</p>
